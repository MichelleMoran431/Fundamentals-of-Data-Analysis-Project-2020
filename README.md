# Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Project-2020
Project 2020 - Fundamentals of Data analysis. Using the Powerproduction dataset and jupyter notebook


Task
To perform and explain simple linear regression using Python on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle.

The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power from wind speed values using the data set as basis. It must contain the following : 

- Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the dataset
- An explanation of your regresssion and an analysis of its accuracy
- Standard items in a git repository such as a README

Further information to enhance submission : To compare the simple linear regression to other types of regression on this data set.


The following packages were used to run statistical analysis and visualise the graphs for this project.

Python https://www.python.org/downloads/

Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ - is the easiest way to perfrom Python data science machine learning on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/ - pandas is an "open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tool."

Scripy https://pypi.org/project/Scripy/ - which allows the user to run system commands in the same shell through it's main tool *shell.Run().

Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ - is the fundamental package for scientific computing within Python.

Matplotlib https://matplotlib.org/ - is a 2D plotting library within Python within which the user can generate a wide variety of figures, including plots, histograms, scetterplots etc.

Seaborn https://seaborn.pydata.org/ - is a Python data visualisation library based on matplotlib. It provides a high level interface for drawing infromative statistical graphs.

Ploty https://plot.ly/ - Plotly provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools for individuals and collaboration, as well as scientific graphing libraries for Python, R, MATLAB, Perl etc.

Cufflinks https://plot.ly/python/v3/ipython-notebooks/cufflinks/

Scikit-learn https://scikit-learn.org - Scikit-learn is a simple and effecient tool for data mining and data analysis.

Importing packages
The above packages can be imported into Python. Use Import function in Python as follows:
